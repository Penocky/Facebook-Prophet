Tool for producing high quality forecasts for time series data that has multiple seasonality with linear or non-linear growth.
- hourly, daily, or weekly observations with at least a few months (preferably a year) of history
- strong multiple “human-scale” seasonalities: day of week and time of year
- important holidays that occur at irregular intervals that are known in advance (e.g. the Super Bowl)
- a reasonable number of missing observations or large outliers
- historical trend changes, for instance due to product launches or logging changes
- trends that are non-linear growth curves, where a trend hits a natural limit or saturates
